This is a custom label you can use to organize your patch and label sub-assemblies, for example you might have a series of modules labeled "DRUM MACHINE". If you enter a lot of text, it can fit a second line nicely. You can also flip the text orientation as shown in these examples.

![One line, bottom to top](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")
![Two lines, top to bottom](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")
