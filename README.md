# Interrobang modules (free)

Free modules for the [VCV Rack virtual modular synth](https://vcvrack.com/). These will be mostly visual and UX-focused at first, then hopefully more musical over time.

### Scribble Strip, [3 HP](http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm) (SS-3)
This is a custom label you can use to organize your patch and label sub-assemblies, for example you might have a series of modules labeled "DRUM MACHINE". If you enter a lot of text, it can fit a second line nicely. You can also flip the text orientation as shown in these examples.

_This module uses the swell [Mad Midnight Marker](res/mad-midnight-marker-font) typeface by Darrell Flood (dadiomouse@gmail.com)._
